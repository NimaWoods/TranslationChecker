Language Detection Profiles

This directory contains language detection profiles used by the language detection library based on the [language-detection](https://github.com/shuyo/language-detection) project by Shuyo Oda.

#### Structure
Each subdirectory within the `profiles` folder represents a specific language. The folder contains a model for detecting text written in that language.

Each language profile contains the necessary data required by the language detection library to determine whether a given text is written in that language.

#### License
The profiles are generated using a tool provided by Shuyo Oda's [language-detection](https://github.com/shuyo/language-detection) project. Please refer to the original repository for licensing information.
